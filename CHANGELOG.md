## 0.6.0
(2019/06/13)

### Changed
- The splunk_hec module now supports customizing the `fact_terminus` and `facts_cache_terminus` names in the custom routes.yaml it deploys. If you are using a different facts_terminus (ie, not PuppetDB), you will want to set that parameter. Please note that this will come with a breaking change in functionality - Switches to the fact terminus cache setting via routes.yaml to ensure compatibility with CD4PE, see Fact Terminus Support for guides on how to change it.

## 0.5.0
(2019/06/11)

### Added
- Advanced configuration for puppet:summary, puppet:facts and puppet:metrics to allow for the support of multiple indexes
- Additional documentation updates
- Added support for individual sourcetype urls
- Added ability to define multiple hec tokens on a sourcetype basis
- Addition of basic acceptance testing using Litmus
- The module is now under the power of the PDK
- Addition of the `saved_report` flag for the splunk_hec application - Allows the user to test some of the splunk_hec functionality, submits the result directly to the splunk configuration
- Addition of the splunk_hec puppet face/app allowing for a cat json | puppet splunk_hec like workflow. The primary functionality of this code is to enable sending pe metrics data to Splunk using the current CS best practices for collecting the CS data.
- Major changes to module were done to enable the Fact Terminus:
  - util/splunk_hec.rb created for common access methods
  - consistent info and error handling for both reports and facts
  - performance profile support for Fact Terminus
  - Documentation updated with guide and default facts listed
  - Module updated to optionally manage reports setting in puppet.conf
  - Module updated to add new parameters and template values
  - Fact collection time added to puppet report processor
  - SSL handling and documentation improved

### Fixed
